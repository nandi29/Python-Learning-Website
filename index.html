<h2>PYTHON </h2>
<p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.reference-</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS </h1>
<p>Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.

Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.</p>

						</li>
	<p>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.
		It emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60 programming languages,[1] with the latter including support for block structures.</p>
	<p>Structured programming is most frequently used with deviations that allow for clearer programs-</p>
	<p>1.Exceptional Handling.</p>
	<p>2.Early Exit.</p>
	<p>3.Multiple Entry.</p>
	<p>4.State Machines.</p>
	<p>
	
The languages that support Structured programming approach are:</p>

<p>C,C++,Java,C#,etc.</p>
	<p>ADVANTAGES OF STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING APPROACH   are:</p>
<p>1.Easier to read and understand</p>
<p>2.User Friendly</p>
<p>3.Easier to Maintain</p>
<p>4.Mainly problem based instead of being machine based</p>
<p>5.Development is easier as it requires less effort and time</p>
<p>6.Easier to Debug</p>
<p>7.Machine-Independent, mostly.</p>

									    <h4> Procedural Programming </h4>	
							</li>
	<p>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming,[citation needed] based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.
